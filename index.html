        <p>Why do we need Branches?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to keep track of the changes in each version of our codebase.</li>
          <li>to be able to revert back to previous versions if needed.</li>
          <li>
            to work with multiple developers simultaneously without causing
            conflicts between their codes.
          </li>
          <li>
            to test different features and then merge them into the main branch
            when they're ready for production.
          </li>
          <li>
            to make sure that all the tests pass before merging any new code
            into the main branch.
          </li>
          <li>
            to have a backup plan, just in case something goes wrong during
            development or testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            to ensure that everyone is working on the same version of the
            codebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            to avoid confusion by having separate branches for different
            tasks/features.
          </li>
          <li>to share your ideas with others while you develop them.</li>
          <li>to collaborate effectively with other developers.</li>
        </ul>
