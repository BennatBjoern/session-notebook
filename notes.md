why do we need branches?

1. to keep track of the changes in each version of our codebase.
2. to be able to revert back to previous versions if needed.
3. to work with multiple developers simultaneously without causing conflicts between their codes.
4. to test different features and then merge them into the main branch when they're ready for production.
5. to make sure that all the tests pass before merging any new code into the main branch.
6. to have a backup plan, just in case something goes wrong during development or testing.
7. to ensure that everyone is working on the same version of the codebase.
8. to avoid confusion by having separate branches for different tasks/features.
9. to share your ideas with others while you develop them.
10. to collaborate effectively with other developers.
